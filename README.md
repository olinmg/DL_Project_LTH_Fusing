1. experiments:

2. results_and_plots: contains the results of the ran experiments and the code to create plots from them
    - plot_non_retrained.py: run this to generate the plots shown in the paper for FaP and PaF at different sparsities and fusion importances. The experiment results will be sourced from "fullDict_results_non_retrained" and the resulting plots will be stored to "plots_non_retrained".
    - plot_retrained.py: run this to generated the plots shown in the paper for FaP and PaF with retraining. The experiment results will be sourced from "fullDict_results_non_retrained" and the resulting plots will be stored to "plots_non_retrained".
